        <h3>Who am I? Just a small town girl. Living in a lonely world.
          JK. But I do live in a small town. I've lived in Madera since 2001,
          graduated high school in 07. I had the privilege of figuring out a career
          in a post recession world. So what did I do? How did I survive? I got into the family business of course!
          I got my real estate license at the young age of 18. Worked as a property manager for the next 10 years. 
          Learned a lot, but am now trying to shift my focus to a new career.
